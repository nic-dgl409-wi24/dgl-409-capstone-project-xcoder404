**Shyam's website:-** "Hey there! So, I wanted to tell you about this really cool website my classmate Shyam made. It's called Fit Finder. Basically, it helps you find the perfect physical activities based on your energy level. So, if you're feeling super pumped and ready to go, it'll suggest some intense workouts. But if you're more in the mood for something chill, it'll suggest some relaxing activities instead. It's all about helping you stay active in a way that fits your vibe. Pretty neat, right?"
