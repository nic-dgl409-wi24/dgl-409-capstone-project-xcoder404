# User feedback and guidance





Hey there,

Just checked out the website's heatmaps, and there are some interesting insights!

Seems like folks on desktops are more into scrolling down the page, but only about half of them actually make it to the bottom. Looks like there's room to grab their attention better down there.

Also, it's cool to see that desktop users are really digging the "Let's Ride" and "Get Started" buttons. They're definitely showing interest in the product and service.

But when it comes to mobile users, they're mostly clicking on the "Blogs" link. Looks like they're more into getting more info rather than jumping straight into the main offer.

So, here are a couple of takeaways:
1. We might wanna tweak the website to be more mobile-friendly, so it looks good and works well on different screen sizes.
2. Adding more visuals, like images or videos, especially near the top of the page, could help showcase the benefits of the product or service right away.
3. And hey, let's make those calls to action super clear and compelling, like "Sign Up" or "Contact," to keep users engaged and reduce any bounce rates.
