## Deploying a React Project on cPanel

If you're hosting your React project on cPanel, you'll typically follow these steps to deploy it:

1. **Build Your React App**: Before deploying to cPanel, you need to build your React app. This creates an optimized production build of your project that can be served by a web server. Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload Files to cPanel**: Once your React app is built, you'll need to upload the contents of the `build` directory to your cPanel hosting account. You can use an FTP client or cPanel's built-in File Manager to upload the files.

3. **Create a Subdomain (Optional)**: If you want to serve your React app from a subdomain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`), you can create a subdomain in cPanel and point it to the directory where you uploaded your React app files.

4. **Set Up Rewrite Rules (Optional)**: If you're using React Router for client-side routing, you may need to set up rewrite rules in your cPanel's `.htaccess` file to ensure that your app's routes work correctly. You can do this by adding the following code to the `.htaccess` file in your React app's directory:
   ```
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /
   RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**: Once the files are uploaded and any necessary configurations are made, you should be able to access your React app by visiting the corresponding domain or subdomain in your web browser.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your React project on cPanel hosting provided by imdg.ca. If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, you can refer to cPanel's documentation or reach out to imdg.ca's support team for assistance.
